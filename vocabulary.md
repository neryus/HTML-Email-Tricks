**Email client**: An email client is the application being used to render the email. Think: Outlook for Desktop, Gmail Web, or Apple Mail.

**Sender name**: The sender name tells viewers who sent the email. This is most likely the name of your company or brand.

**Subject line**: The subject line tells subscribers what your email is about. The most effective subject lines reflect the content in the email and encourage engagement.

**Preheader text**: Preheader text is customizable content between 35 and 140 characters that appears next to or below the subject line in email inboxes.

**User-initiated** send: When you choose the subscribers and the time to send a message—that’s a user-initiated send. These are typically marketing-related messages. You manage the entire process of a user-initiated email message through Marketing Cloud. A monthly newsletter sent to company employees is an example of a user-initiated send.

**Triggered** send: A triggered send occurs in response to an action that your subscriber takes. Although you define the content and interaction for that message, it sends automatically when a subscriber does something. These are often transactional messages. For example, sending a confirmation email to a customer who purchases something on your website is a triggered send.
