##Code editors and plugins

Here is only my opinion on different code editors, what plugins, features and tools I use.

###Adobe Dreamweaver
At work I'm using Dreamweaver version CS5.5 and I find it very good for editing, troubleshooting an email templates. Mostly because of design view and select tool.

Tools:
- Find and Replace (current document, open documents, folder)

Plugins:
- Emmet

###Atom
