## Code editors
Code editors for development of HTML emails:

### Adobe Dreamweaver
My work machine get update, actually only Adobe CS was updated to CS6.
At work I'm using Dreamweaver version CS5.5 and I find it very good for editing, troubleshooting an email templates. Mostly because of design view and select tool.

Tools:
- Find and Replace (current document, open documents, folder)
- Select tool in design view
- Collapse full tag
- Quick tag editor (to quickly wrap text in tags select it, press Ctrl+T to open the tag editor, start typing to move quickly to the tags you want to wrap the text in, using the up down arrow keys if need).
- Apply/Remove comment
- W3C Validation
- Preview in browser
- Code hints
- Code snippets.
  To import custom snippets to the Dreamweaver is a bit [complicated stuff](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/1005503). First you need to create custom snippet, after you will be able to locate snippets folder where you can paste in the custom snippets. The CS6 folder is here: C:\Users\David\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Dreamweaver CS6\en_US\Configuration\Snippets"
- Default keyboard shortcut for break line element

Plugins:
- [Emmet](https://github.com/emmetio/dreamweaver), after some headache to install and set up it on Dreamweaver this tool saves a lot of repeating typing.

### Atom

My extensions:
- [eddy-malou-lorem-ipsum](https://atom.io/packages/eddy-malou-lorem-ipsum)
- [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/eddy-malou-lorem-ipsum)
- [spacegray-atom-dark-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/spacegray-atom-dark-syntax)
- [pigments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
- [html-nested-comments](https://atom.io/packages/html-nested-comments)
- [Palladium](https://atom.io/packages/palladium) - didn't tried yet. But it's sounds promising to be able to send test emails straight from Atom.

### Brackets

I find Brackets very usefull for creating email templates from scratch.

Tools:
- Find function (Alt+F3), it selects all match strings and you can them all in one, just start typing new string.
- Multi selection is awesome for emails.

My extensions:
- [Brackets Editor Bookmarks](https://github.com/JeffryBooher/brackets-bookmarks-extension)

### HTMLPad

### Litmus Builder

### Notepad++

### Sublime Text

## Image Optimizers

### [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), TinyJPG

At the moment it's the best tool to optimize image size. Easy to use for small amount of images.

### [Kraken.io](https://kraken.io/web-interface) Web

Has a free option with web interface, which is good if you using this tools from time to time or just couple times a day. But I found that not every jpg or png image would be optimized.

### [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/online)
### [Compressor](https://compressor.io/)
### [Jpegmini](http://www.jpegmini.com/)

## Image editors

### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
After creating first email designs I found it quite interesting tool. Will update this later after email designs need to be converted to HTML documents.

### [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/)
The free image editor is web-based and comes with a UI that is very similar to what youâ€™re used from Photoshop. Photopea supports layers, layer masks and blend modes, and offers a lot of the tools that you love from Photoshop: the Magic Wand, Lasso, and Clone Tool, for example. It can handle PSD, Gimp, and WebP files, as well as common image formats, of course. A nice alternative for quick edits.

## GIF
### Animated GIF maker [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/gifgenerator)
Make animated GIFs from video files, Youtube, or video websites.
