##Code editors

Email developer code editors, usefull plugins, features and tools.

###Adobe Dreamweaver
At work I'm using Dreamweaver version CS5.5 and I find it very good for editing, troubleshooting an email templates. Mostly because of design view and select tool.

Tools:
- Find and Replace (current document, open documents, folder)
- Select tool in design view
- Collapse full tag
- Quick tag editor (to quickly wrap text in tags select it, press Ctrl+T to open the tag editor, start typing to move quickly to the tags you want to wrap the text in, using the up down arrow keys if need).
- Apply/Remove comment
- W3C Validation
- Preview in browser
- Code hints
- Code snippets
- Default keyboard shortcut for break line element

Plugins:
- Emmet, after some headache to install it in Dreamweaver this tool saves a lot of repeating typing.

###Atom

###Brackets

I find Brackets very usefull for creating email templates from scratch.

Tools:
- Find function (Alt+F3), it selects all match strings and you can them all in one, just start typing new string.
- Multi selection is awesome for emails.

My set up:
- Emmet
